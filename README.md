The Odin Project - HTML Section

## Overview
The aim of this project was to apply the skills I learned in The Odin Project with Git, GitHub, and HTML. I created a functioning webpage that uses relative links to go to 3 recipes. Each recipe page contains an absolute link to the course of the recipe, and a royalty-free picture.
